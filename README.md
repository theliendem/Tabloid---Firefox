Do ever feel like you have too many tabs open? Of course you do, it happens to the best of us.

Have you ever wanted to be roasted for it? No? I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.

Tabloid is browser extension that roasts you based on what type and how many tabs you have open. That's why it's called "Tab"loid. Get it? You do? I'm not funny? I didn't hear that either...

*\*ahem\** Aaaanyways, It's also a great tab management system, allowing you to categorize your tabs and giving you detailed breakdowns of the tabs you have open.
